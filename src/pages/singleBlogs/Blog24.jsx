              If you recently attended a wedding it is highly likely that you
              would have seen a drone flying over the venue of the wedding,
              capturing the moments of happiness and giving you the most
              beautiful shots from a safe distance. Similarly if you travel to
              country side you might see these semi-autonomous machines
              sprinkling fertilizers in farms or in some metro cities like Delhi
              they have also started doing deliveries.

            <p>
              In the past 3 years drones from being a machine of concern has
              become a machine of help for Indians. It has proven to boost
              productivity across sectors and a new stream of revenue for the
              struggling manufacturing sector of India. But how did this come
              about? Lets find out…

            <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
              <strong>Historical Development of Drone Technology</strong>
            </h3>

            <p>
              The history of drones dates back to&nbsp;1783 when French
              inventors Joseph Michel and Jacques Montgolfier launched the first
              unmanned hot air balloon. This marked the beginning of unmanned
              aerial vehicles.&nbsp;From there some key milestones in drone
              development include:
            </p>

            <ol className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                <strong>1849:</strong> Austrian military used unmanned balloons
                loaded with explosives to&nbsp;attack Venice, Italy.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Late 19th century:</strong> Nikola Tesla demonstrated
                the first radio-controlled craft, a 3-foot long boat.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>1917:</strong> Charles F. Kettering developed the first
                aerial&nbsp;torpedo, capable of reaching speeds of 50 mph and
                traveling up to 75 miles.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>1935:</strong> The British Royal Navy launched the
                Queen&nbsp;Bee, a remotely controlled aircraft used for target
                practice.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>World War II:</strong> The United States developed the
                Curtis N2C-2, a remote-controlled propeller aircraft used for
                anti-aircraft gunner training.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>2006:</strong> The United States Federal Aviation
                Administration (FAA) began allowing the use of UAVs
                in&nbsp;civilian airspace.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              From being known as the machines of war in early 2010s companies
              like Amazon started using drones for door to door delivery.

              Drones in India and Government Policies around it
            </h3>

            <p>
              In India drones have had a bitter sweet relationship. Despite that
              India’s drone industry has witnessed significant growth in recent
              years, driven by a series of government reforms and initiatives
              aimed at fostering innovation, domestic manufacturing, and safe

            </p>

            <p>
              The Indian government has taken a structured approach to
              regulating and promoting drone technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below are the key milestones of this love hate relation between
              India and its Drones :
            </p>

            <ol className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                <strong>October 2014: Ban on Commercial Use of Drones</strong>
                <ul className="wp-block-list">
                  <li>
                    The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) imposed a
                    ban on the commercial use of drones due to security
                    concerns, marking the beginning of regulatory oversight.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>August 2018: Civil Aviation Regulations 1.0</strong>
                <ul className="wp-block-list">
                  <li>
                    The DGCA introduced comprehensive regulations for drone
                    operations, including guidelines for registration,
                    operation, and safety protocols. This was the first step
                    toward legalizing commercial drone use.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>August 2021: New Drone Rules</strong>
                <ul className="wp-block-list">
                  <li>
                    Simplified regulations replaced earlier frameworks, reducing
                    compliance burdens and making it easier for startups and
                    businesses to manufacture and operate drones.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                <strong>February 2022: Drone Import Policy</strong>
                <ul className="wp-block-list">
                  <li>
                    The import of foreign-made drones was restricted to promote
                    indigenous manufacturing under the “Make in India”
                    initiative.
                  </li>

                research, defense, and security purposes. This policy aligns
                with the “Make in India” initiative, encouraging domestic
                production and reducing dependency on imports.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>2. Drone Airspace Policy</strong>
            </p>

            <ul className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                90% of Indian airspace is designated as a Green Zone where
                drones can operate up to 400 feet without requiring security
                clearance or registration for non-commercial operations. This
                simplifies drone operations across sectors such as agriculture,
                logistics, and surveillance.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>3. Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme</strong>
            </p>

            <ul className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                The PLI scheme allocates INR 120 crore over three financial
                years to incentivize domestic production of drones and
                components. It offers a consistent 20% PLI rate across all three
                years, providing stability for manufacturers.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>4. Drone Shakti Scheme</strong>
            </p>

            <ul className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                Introduced in FY 2022-23, this scheme aims to spur innovation in

            <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
              <strong>Other Government Initiatives</strong>
            </h3>

            <p>
              In addition to these core policies, several other initiatives have
              been introduced:
            </p>

            <ul className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Relaxation of Drone Guidelines</strong>: Simplified
                regulations have increased market access for startups and
                foreign investors by easing operational restrictions.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Openness to Foreign Investment</strong>: Foreign-owned
                companies are now allowed to operate drones in India without
                restrictions, enhancing technological expertise and attracting
                global investment.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Investment Target</strong>: The government aims to
                attract $600 million in investments over three years for
                innovation in manufacturing capabilities and technology
                adoption.
              </li>

                <strong>Relaxation in Drone License Requirements</strong>: The
                requirement for a drone pilot’s license has been removed;
                instead, a Remote Pilot Certificate (RPC) from a DGCA-approved
                school will be required through the DigitalSky platform.
              </li>

            <p>
              Based on the <em>Drone Rules 2021</em> issued by the Ministry of
              Civil Aviation in India, Drones are categorized by weight, wing
              type, power source, range, and size.
            </p>

            <ul className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                In terms of <strong>weight</strong>, drones range from{" "}
                <strong>Nano</strong> (≤0.25kg), used for recreational purposes
                or indoor inspections, to <strong>Large</strong> drones
                (&gt;150kg), which are often employed in logistics or military
                applications. For example, Nano drones can be used for personal
                photography or short-range surveillance, while large drones are
                used in cargo delivery or defense.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Wing types</strong> include{" "}
                <strong>Single Rotor</strong>, <strong>Fixed Wing</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>Multi-Rotor</strong>, and{" "}
                <strong>Fixed-Wing Hybrid VTOL</strong>. Multi-rotor drones are
                commonly used in aerial photography and agriculture for crop
                monitoring due to their stability and ease of control.
                Fixed-wing drones, with longer flight times, are ideal for
                mapping large areas or surveying infrastructure like pipelines.
              </li>

              <li>
                Drones are powered by various sources such as{" "}
                <strong>batteries</strong>, <strong>gasoline</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>solar</strong>, or <strong>hydrogen fuel cells</strong>.
                Battery-powered drones dominate consumer markets, while hydrogen
                fuel cell-powered drones are gaining traction for long-endurance
                missions like environmental monitoring.
              </li>

              <li>
                In terms of <strong>range</strong>, drones vary from{" "}
                <strong>very close-range</strong> (&lt;5 km) to{" "}
                <strong>long-range</strong> (&gt;644 km). Close-range drones are
                often used in real estate or construction for site inspections,
                while long-range drones serve in border surveillance or disaster
                management.
              </li>

              <li>
                Finally, drone <strong>size</strong> is classified from very
                small (&lt;51 mm) to large (&gt;640 mm). Small drones are often
                used in confined spaces like indoor inspections or
                search-and-rescue missions in tight areas. Large drones are
                utilised for heavy-duty tasks like transporting goods over long
                distances.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These classifications help industries select the appropriate drone
              type based on their operational requirements and application.
            </p>

                </strong>{" "}
                Drone designs are evolving with a focus on aerodynamics for
                longer flight durations. Testing remains experimental, requiring
                a trial-and-error approach. Hardware improvements include
                smaller high-resolution cameras and enhanced storage capacity.
                Edge and fog computing enable real-time data processing onboard
                drones, reducing latency. All these needs to be learnt at scale
                for the PMs to design next generation drones.

                <strong>Understand the market dynamics beyond PMF</strong> The
                drone market is still in its early stages, with most companies
                at the seed stage. The industry is fragmented, with no major
                consolidation yet. Success is measured by adoption rates rather
                than revenue consolidation. Each funding round averages $27
                million, reflecting strong investor interest. So PMs thinking
                beyond PMF towards large deals are expected to last longer.

                  Holistically design the future of drone ecosystem
                </strong>{" "}
                Key innovations include alternate fuels like solar and hydrogen,
                3D printing for affordable spare parts, and hybrid drones
                capable of both vertical and horizontal flight. AI-driven
                autonomy is also advancing, allowing drones to perform tasks
                without human intervention. So PMs need to think of all these
                factors and keep pace with them.

              With these developments, the drone industry is poised for
              significant growth as it transitions from early adopters to
              mainstream markets also expect some consolidation.

            <h3 className="wp-block-heading">Challenges</h3>

            <p>
              Despite the rapid growth of the drone industry, several challenges
              remain that hinder its full potential like :
            </p>

            <ol className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Lack of Test Beds</strong>: There are no dedicated test
                beds for drones, making it difficult for companies to test and
                refine their products in controlled environments. This limits
                innovation and delays the development of new drone technologies.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>
                  Absence of Pilot Guidelines and Training Institutions
                </strong>
                : The drone industry lacks clear guidelines for drone pilots,
                and there are very few training institutions available. This gap
                creates a shortage of skilled operators, which is crucial for
                scaling drone operations.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Security and Air Traffic Management</strong>: There are
                no centralized public or private entities managing
                security-related guidelines for drone air traffic. This lack of
                regulation poses risks in terms of safety and coordination,
                especially as drone usage increases.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Import Dependence</strong>: Nearly 50% of drone
                equipment, including critical components like communication
                modules, cameras, and propellers, is imported from China. These
                components make up 45% of the overall cost, creating a
                dependency that could affect supply chains and pricing.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Inadequate 5G Infrastructure</strong>: The poor progress
                on 5G infrastructure is a significant barrier to large-scale
                drone operations. Current 4G bandwidth cannot handle the high
                data volumes required for advanced drone applications, limiting
                their effectiveness in real-time data transmission.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Battery Dependency</strong>: Drones still face
                challenges with battery life and charging infrastructure.
                Limited battery capacity restricts flight duration, while the
                lack of widespread charging stations makes it difficult to scale
                drone operations across larger areas.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Lack of Skilled Personnel</strong>: While there are
                government initiatives like PM Skilling, they are not tailored
                to the specific needs of the drone industry. More courses
                focused on aerodynamics and drone technology are needed to train
                professionals who can drive innovation in this space.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the continued
              growth and success of the drone industry.
