                Understanding your competitors is not just an advantage, it’s a
                necessity. We usually see competitors as threats, but
                competitors can be valuable assets as well. They set trends
                sometimes, provide market insights, and ultimately drive
                innovation that benefits the entire industry.

                Competitor analysis is a crucial skill that informs your product
                strategy and takes it from good to great. By deeply
                understanding your competitors, you gain strategic insights that
                can help you refine your marketing approach, expand your
                customer base, and increase your market share. But how do you
                conduct an effective competitor analysis?

                This is where competitor analysis frameworks come into play.
                These tools provide structured approaches to gathering,
                organizing, and interpreting vital information about your
                competitors. From marketing strategies to product offerings,
                these frameworks help you visualize the competitive landscape
                and predict market trends.

                In this article, we’ll explore seven essential competitor
                analysis frameworks that every product manager should master.
                Whether you’re a startup looking to disrupt the market or an
                established player aiming to maintain your edge, these
                frameworks will equip you with the knowledge to make informed

                Types of Competitors To conduct a comprehensive analysis, it’s
                important to consider different types of competitors:

                  Apple’s iPhone vs. Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones).
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Indirect competitors:</strong>&nbsp;Companies that

                  (e.g., Uber vs. public transportation).

              <ol className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  Strengths: Identify what the competitor does well. This could
                  include brand recognition, unique features, or strong
                  partnerships.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Weaknesses: Pinpoint areas where the competitor falls short,
                  such as poor customer service or outdated technology.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Opportunities: Look for external factors that could benefit
                  the competitor, like emerging markets or new technologies.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Threats: Consider external challenges that could harm the

                  entrants in the market.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Threat of new entrants: Assess how easily new competitors can
                  enter the market. Consider factors like entry barriers,
                  capital requirements, and regulations.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Bargaining power of suppliers: Evaluate how much control
                  suppliers have over prices and terms. This affects costs and
                  availability of resources.
                </li>

                <li>

                <li>
                  Threat of substitutes: Identify alternative products or

                </li>

                <li>
                  Industry rivalry: Analyze the intensity of competition within

              </ol>

              <p>
                For example, let’s consider how Spotify might use Porter’s Five

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  Threat of new entrants: Medium (high capital requirements, but
                  low switching costs for users)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Bargaining power of suppliers: High (music labels control
                  content)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Bargaining power of buyers: Medium (many choices, but Spotify
                  has a large user base)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Threat of substitutes: High (YouTube, radio, personal music
                  collections)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Industry rivalry: High (competition from Apple Music, Amazon
                  Music, etc.)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This analysis might lead Spotify to focus on exclusive content
                deals, improve user experience, and diversify into podcasts to
                differentiate from competitors and reduce dependence on music
                labels.

                products based on market growth rate and relative market share.
                It categorizes products into four quadrants: Stars, Cash Cows,
                Question Marks, and Dogs.

                <li>
                  Cash Cows: Low growth, high market share. These generate

                </li>

                <li>
                  Question Marks: High growth, low market share. These have

                <li>

              <ol className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  Identify two key attributes that are important to customers

                </li>

                <li>
                  Create a two-dimensional graph with these attributes as axes.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Plot your product and competitors’ products on the graph based
                  on customer perceptions.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Analyze the positioning of products relative to each other.

              </ol>

              <p>
                For example, a smartphone manufacturer creates a perceptual map
                with “Price” on the x-axis and “Innovation” on the y-axis. They

                  Their product is perceived as moderately priced with average

                <li>
                  Competitor A is seen as highly innovative but expensive.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Competitor B is perceived as budget-friendly but less

              <p>This insight could lead the company to either:</p>

              <p>
                a) Emphasize their balance of price and innovation in marketing.

              <p>
                b) Invest in R&amp;D to move up the innovation axis and compete
                more directly with Competitor A.

                For example, in the ride-sharing industry, a Strategic Group

              </ol>

              <p>
                For example, an e-commerce company can map out the customer

                </li>

                <li>
                  There are pain points in the purchase stage due to a

                <li>Post-purchase support is a weakness for the competitor.</li>
