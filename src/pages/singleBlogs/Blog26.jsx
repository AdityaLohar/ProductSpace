                <strong>C</strong> – Comprehend the situation.

              strengthen your response. For example, “Adding feature X could
              improve retention by 15%, as seen in similar cases from
              competitors.”

              <strong>How to Approach:</strong>
            </h4>

            <p>Use a structured approach:</p>

            <ol className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                Clarify assumptions (e.g., population size, product usage).

              <li>Break the problem into smaller components.</li>

              <li>Perform quick calculations and validate your logic.</li>

              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if your final number isn’t perfect,
              recruiters care more about how you think than the exact answer.

            <ul className="wp-block-list">
              <li>
                Structure your thoughts and responses very well before
                answering. Use frameworks like CIRCLES, STAR (Situation, Task,
                Action, Result), or AARRR (Acquisition, Activation, Retention,
                Referral, Revenue).
              </li>

              <li>
                Know the company, tailor your answers to the company’s mission,
                product, and market.
              </li>

              <li>
                Practice behavioral skills since PM roles require collaboration,
                so show empathy, leadership, and communication skills, these are
                very crucial for you to prepare.
              </li>

              <li>
                Be data-informed, not data-obsessed. Use data to support your
                ideas but don’t ignore intuition or user experience.
              </li>
            </ul>
