                As a product manager, having a strong product sense is essential
                for making sound judgments and delivering products that truly
                resonate with users.
              </p>

              <p>
                Product sense, also known as product intuition or product
                judgment, is the ability to deeply understand what makes a great
                product and identify opportunities to enhance the user
                experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                While some may believe that product sense is an innate skill,
                the truth is that it can be actively developed and honed through
                deliberate practice, exposure to diverse products, and
                continuous learning. In this guide, we’ll explore the key
                components of product sense and provide practical exercises to
                help you sharpen this invaluable skill.

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">What is product sense?</h3>

              <p>Product sense encompasses several critical elements:</p>

              <ol className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>User empathy:</strong>&nbsp;Understanding user needs,
                  pain points, motivations, and behaviors are at the core of
                  product sense. It involves developing a deep connection with
                  the target audience and viewing the product through their
                  lens.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Business acumen:</strong>&nbsp;Strong product sense
                  requires an understanding of market trends, competitive
                  landscapes, revenue models, and the ability to align product
                  decisions with business objectives.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Creative problem-solving:</strong>&nbsp;Product
                  managers with exceptional product sense can generate
                  innovative solutions to address user problems and business
                  challenges, often by drawing inspiration from diverse sources.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Design sense:</strong>&nbsp;Appreciating the
                  principles of good user experience (UX) and interface design
                  is crucial for creating intuitive and delightful products.

              <p>
                When someone with a strong product sense interacts with a
                product, they can not only critique the user experience but also
                provide insights into the product’s differentiation, potential
                threats, adjacent use cases, and alignment with user and
                business goals.
              </p>

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                Where does good product intuition come from?
              </h3>

              <p>
                Intuition is a shortcut to rational thinking, built from past
                experiences. Developing product intuition requires actively
                engaging in various activities that broaden your understanding
                and perspective.
              </p>

              <p>Here are four key avenues to gain this experience:</p>

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                1. Observe and analyze products
              </h3>

              <p>
                Observing products with a critical eye helps you understand what
                makes them work. Follow these steps:
              </p>

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  Examine every app on your phone, noting navigation icons, text
                  strings, and layout grids.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Slow down and observe what the app is made of, rather than
                  just using it.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Take screenshots, especially during the onboarding process, to
                  review later.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                2. Learn from industry experts
              </h3>

              <p>
                Reading provides access to the thoughts and experiences of
                others. Focus on:
              </p>

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Design</strong>: Read design works to understand
                  decision-making processes.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Case Studies</strong>: Look for detailed accounts of
                  how products were developed and evolved.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                3. Engage in product discussions
              </h3>

              <p>Engage with product designers and other product managers:</p>

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  Join conversations, whether at work, in college, or through
                  online communities.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Listen to discussions about product decisions, noting what
                  ideas are raised, accepted, or rejected.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                4. Apply your knowledge practically
              </h3>

              <p>
                Execution is crucial but time-consuming. Engage in side projects
                to apply your knowledge, but be mindful that this method has a
                slower feedback cycle compared to others.
              </p>

              <p>

              </h3>

              <p>When evaluating a product, ask:</p>

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>What</strong>&nbsp;problem is it solving?
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Who</strong>&nbsp;has this problem?
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Who</strong>&nbsp;are they competing against?
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>How</strong>&nbsp;are they solving this problem
                  differently?

                <li>
                  <strong>How</strong>&nbsp;was your experience using this
                  product?
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This analysis helps you understand the product’s market,
                competitors, and user experience.

                  Propose improvements and justify why your redesign is better.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Consider potential issues your redesign might introduce.

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                5. Design a new feature or product
              </h3>

              <p>
                Think of a product or feature you wish existed and design it:

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>Define the use case and target audience.</li>

                <li>Identify competitors and broader competition.</li>

                <li>Focus on the concept rather than the detailed design.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                6. Build a side project with no-code tools

                business helps in making informed product decisions. This
                knowledge provides a solid foundation to enhance your product
                sense.
              </p>

              <h3 className="wp-block-heading">
                8. Read “How did X do Y” case studies
              </h3>

              <p>
                Learn from the experiences of other product managers and
                companies by reading case studies that detail how specific
                challenges were addressed and goals achieved. However, approach
                these stories critically, as they may omit important details.

              <p>
                Broaden your product experience. Analyze how each product
                functions and identify any groundbreaking or one-of-a-kind
                features. See if there are recurring design elements used across
                different products. Form your own judgment on whether the design
                choices are effective in achieving the product’s objectives.
