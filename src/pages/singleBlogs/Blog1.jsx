                Let’s talk about the persistent, age-old questions that most of
                the aspiring product managers ask – ‘How technical should I be
                as a product manager?’ We’ve heard it time and again: you don’t
                need to be a tech whiz to be a successful PM. And yet, this
                misconception lingers around.
              </p>

              <p>
                Product managers come from very diverse background, bringing a
                diverse range of skills to the table. So why do we keep circling
                back to technical expertise? It’s time to dive deeper into the
                topic and understand the nuances of the role of tech in product
                management.

                What do we mean by ‘Technical skills’?
              </h3>

              <p>
                Technical skills can mean different things depending on the
                industry and the role, and even within software development, the
                requirements vary across teams. However, some core skills are
                widely recognized like programming languages, databases, data
                structures and algorithms, APIs etc.
              </p>

              <p>
                Technology is constantly evolving, which makes it exciting for
                those who are already part of it. But for outsiders, especially
                those transitioning from fields like marketing, sales or the
                vast landscape of tech can seem intimidating, almost like a
                barrier to entry.
              </p>

              <p>
                The good thing is that Product Management sits at the
                intersection of design, business, and technology. If you’re
                strong in any of those areas and eager to learn the others,
                there’s a place for you in product management.
              </p>

              <p>
                While PMs work within the tech industry and product development
                involves building technology, the level of technical knowledge
                required isn’t as daunting as it might appear. With the right
                mindset and willingness to learn, those technical skills are far
                more accessible than they first seem.
              </p>

              <h3

                Should a PM know how to code?
              </h3>

              <p>
                A product manager doesn’t need to code, but having a basic
                understanding of several technical concepts is definitely an
                advantage. The key is to understand how the system works rather
                than knowing the syntax of a language.
              </p>

              <p>
                For instance, if you can comprehend the complexity of a feature
                request from an engineering point of view, you can make more
                informed decisions. But no, you won’t be writing code; you’ll be
                translating business needs into something developers can build.
              </p>

              <h3
                className="wp-block-heading"

                Do product managers need to have a technical background?
              </h3>

              <p>
                A technical background is not a strict requirement for all PM
                roles. However, in some industries, such as SaaS or deep tech,
                it might be more valued. The goal is to bridge the gap between
                the technical and the business side, so while you don’t need to
                be an engineer, you should be able to “speak the language”.
              </p>

              <p>
                Having a technical background can make learning this easier, but
                many successful PMs come from non-technical fields and develop
                the necessary technical acumen over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here are a few reasons why having a basic understanding of tech
                might be crucial:
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
                1. Making Technical Trade-offs
              </h4>

              <p>
                As a PM, understanding the technical architecture of your
                product is essential when making trade-offs. For example, if
                you’re working on an analytics feature, should it be in
                real-time, or can there be a slight delay? These decisions have
                significant technical implications. A basic understanding of how
                things work will help you weigh the pros and cons effectively.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
                2. Understanding Technical Feasibility
              </h4>

              <p>
                Product Managers are constantly evaluating opportunities, and
                prioritizing them requires knowing the technical effort
                involved. While your tech team will provide the specifics, it’s
                helpful to have a rough idea yourself. This way, you can avoid
                repeatedly going back to your developers for estimates. You
                don’t need to calculate the exact workload, but having a sense
                of what’s feasible and what’s a moonshot helps streamline the
                process.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">3. Managing Technical Debt</h4>

              <p>
                A common mistake is to allocate a percentage of bandwidth to
                technical debt without understanding what it really entails. As
                a PM, you’ll need to prioritize technical debt just like any
                other task—based on its impact and effort. It’s tough to
                prioritize something you don’t understand, so having some
                technical insight is crucial.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">4. Assisting in Debugging</h4>

              <p>
                Debugging may not be the most glamorous part of the job, but
                having a general sense of how your product works can be a huge
                time-saver. You won’t need to find the root cause yourself, but
                being able to say, “This issue might stem from either A or B,”
                will help your team troubleshoot more efficiently.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">5. Working with Data</h4>

              <p>
                A key part of your role is understanding user problems, and
                product usage data is vital for this. If you don’t have access
                to a data analyst at all times, it’s incredibly helpful to pull
                insights on your own. Knowing basic SQL allows you to be more
                self-sufficient when analyzing data, giving you the autonomy to
                make informed decisions.
              </p>

                6. Navigating the Delivery Process
              </h4>

              <p>
                During the delivery phase, your tech team will move your project
                into production. It’s important for a PM to understand the
                basics of coding environments (like staging, pre-production, and
                production), as well as concepts like branches and pull
                requests. This knowledge ensures smoother communication and
                helps you keep track of the process.

                Do some product management roles have technical requirements?
              </h3>

              <p>
                In companies with highly technical products, the bar for
                technical knowledge is often set higher. If you’re applying for
                a company building tools for developers, AI/Devops, or data
                scientists, you might be expected to understand not only the
                challenges and needs of these users but also the underlying
                technology in great detail, often enough to discuss trade-offs,
                technical specifications, integration processes etc. with
                engineers on a more granular level.
              </p>

              <p>
                These companies usually hire Technical Product Managers (TPM),
                they often work closely with engineering teams and have a
                stronger background in coding, infrastructure, or system
                architecture.

                As a PM, what should you know about tech?
              </h3>

              <p>
                You should be able to grasp high-level concepts like how APIs
                work, the difference between front-end and back-end development,
                the basics of cloud infrastructure, and how databases function.
                It’s crucial to understand the impact of technical decisions on
                the user experience and the business.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, a PM should know how a poor architecture decision
                could lead to scaling problems, or how a slow database could
                affect the product’s performance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here’s a breakdown of some of the key concepts that should be
                within your technical reach:
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">1. Front-end &amp; Back-end</h4>

              <p>
                Front-end refers to the part of the product that users interact
                with—the visual elements like buttons, forms, and navigation.
                It’s what people see and experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                Back-end is everything that happens behind the scenes. It’s
                responsible for the logic, database interactions, server-side
                operations, and handling data.
              </p>

              <p>
                Knowing this distinction helps you understand how different
                teams approach building features and solving problems.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
                2. Mobile vs. Web Architecture
              </h4>

              <p>
                Mobile and web products have different development and
                architectural requirements. For instance, web applications
                usually rely on browser-based technologies (like HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript), while mobile apps have platform-specific
                constraints (iOS vs Android).
              </p>

              <p>
                A mobile app might need more optimization due to device
                limitations (battery life, processing power), while web apps
                depend more on browser compatibility and server performance.
                Understanding these differences helps when prioritizing features
                or addressing platform-specific challenges.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
                3. iOS vs. Android Development
              </h4>

              <p>
                iOS and Android have unique ecosystems, which affect design,
                development, and rollouts. iOS has stricter App Store rules and
                typically requires more scrutiny before approving apps.
              </p>

              <p>
                Android, while more flexible, deals with fragmentation across
                multiple devices with varying specifications, which can impact
                design choices. These factors influence how you plan product
                rollouts and feature releases across different platforms.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">
                4. basic Product Technical Architecture
              </h4>

              <p>
                Having a basic grasp of how your product is built from a
                technical perspective can make a world of difference. You don’t
                need to know all the nitty-gritty details, but ask your tech
                team about the architecture when you have the opportunity. Be
                curious!
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, how does data flow through the system? What are the
                key components? The more you understand this, the better
                equipped you’ll be to make decisions that align with both
                business goals and technical realities.
              </p>

              <h4 className="wp-block-heading">5. APIs &amp; Webhooks</h4>

              <p>
                APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)&nbsp;are tools that
                allow different software systems to communicate with each other.
                For example, if your product integrates with another service
                (like Slack or a payment gateway), this integration is probably
                handled through an API. Understanding how to read API
                documentation means you can evaluate how these integrations work
                and whether they meet the needs of your product.
              </p>

              <p>
                Webhooks&nbsp;are a way for one system to send real-time data to
                another whenever a specific event occurs. For instance, a
                webhook might notify your app when a user completes a payment on
                a third-party platform. Knowing what these are helps you
                understand how your product interacts with other systems in real
                time.
              </p>

                DevOps&nbsp;is the practice of managing the lifecycle of code
                from development to production. As a PM, having a basic
                understanding of coding environments will help you follow the
                delivery process more effectively.
              </p>

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>Staging&nbsp;is where code is tested before release.</li>

                <li>
                  Pre-production (pre-prod)&nbsp;is a final testing environment
                  that closely resembles the live system.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Production&nbsp;is the live environment where users interact
                  with the product.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Branches&nbsp;are separate versions of code where teams work
                  on features independently before merging them.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Pull requests&nbsp;are requests to merge code changes from one
                  branch to another, typically after review and testing.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Understanding these concepts allows you to track project
                progress and speak more effectively with developers when
                discussing timelines and delivery.

                How will recruiters assess your technical knowledge?
              </h3>

              <p>
                Recruiters will likely focus on your ability to collaborate with
                engineers and whether you understand technical trade-offs.
              </p>

              <p>
                When assessing your technical knowledge, recruiters employ
                several strategies like –
              </p>

              <ul className="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  During the interview process, you might encounter a “case
                  study” phase where you’re asked to partner with the lead
                  developer on a feature. This hands-on approach allows the team
                  to observe your thought process when tackling technical
                  challenges.
                </li>

                <li>
                  You might be asked questions like, “Can you explain how an API
                  works?” or “Tell me about a time when you worked with
                  engineers on a technically challenging feature.” The focus
                  isn’t on your ability to code but on whether you can break
                  down complex technical concepts and make informed decisions.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Recruiters often look for candidates who show genuine interest
                  in the technical aspects of the product. They might assess
                  whether you’ve taken initiative to explore technical
                  resources, such as API documentation, as an indicator of your
                  proactive approach and curiosity about technology.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                These methods help recruiters gauge not only your technical
                knowledge but also your problem-solving skills, communication
                abilities, and enthusiasm for technology – all crucial traits
                for a successful Product Manager.

                How to learn technical skills as a product manager?
              </h3>

              <p>
                Start by learning the basics of how software is built.
                Familiarize yourself with terms like API, front-end, back-end,
                databases, and cloud services. You can watch tutorial videos or
                articles to give you a foundational understanding.
              </p>

              <p>
                Spend time with your engineering team—ask them questions,
                observe their process, and learn how they make technical
                decisions. Over time, this will help you develop a stronger
                technical sense.
              </p>

                className="wp-block-heading"

                How to learn product management skills?
              </h3>

              <p>
                Product management skills come from a mix of practical
                experience and learning from others.
              </p>

              <p>
                Read books like&nbsp;Inspired&nbsp;by Marty Cagan
                and&nbsp;Hooked&nbsp;by Nir Eyal can offer a strong foundation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Hands-on experience is key: manage a small side project,
                participate in Product Teardowns and&nbsp;PM Hackathons, join a
                PM community, or enroll in cohort-based programs where you can
                learn from experienced PMs and apply concepts in real-world
                scenarios.
              </p>

              <p>
                Additionally, work on improving your soft skills like
                communication, prioritization, and user empathy—these are just
                as crucial as technical skills in PM.
